# LearningCPP

<br>

```lex
LearningCPP is a repository with Examples, Exams and Tasks from PROG1003 at NTNU.
It contains code made by our lecturer and code I have done myself. Including obligatory submissions.

 > [!IMPORTANT]
 > All tasks "Weektasks" are based on my own interpretation, they should only be used as a reference and not as the correct answer. The "Weektasks-Solutions" on the other hand contains the lecturer solutions, so if you want to fact check your code, they will be the most accurate to the right answer.

You are free to use the code as you wish. There is no such thing as my code or your code. It's ours <3
